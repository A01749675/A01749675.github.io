                    <p>Hello! I'm Carlos Iker Fuentes Reyes, a 22-year-old computer science student currently in my 6th semester at Tecnológico de Monterrey, with an expected graduation in 2026. I am passionate about programming, robotics, data analysis, and game development. Over the years, I’ve gained hands-on experience working with a variety of programming languages including Python, Java, C++, C#, and MATLAB, and have developed a particular interest in using these skills to solve real-world problems.</p>

                    <p>Throughout my academic journey, I have been fortunate to work with cutting-edge technologies such as Oracle SQL, Oracle APEX, and Unity Engine. My professional experience includes an internship at Oracle, where I am part of the MDC Special team under Erik Peterson. In addition to my internship, I’ve also had the privilege of leading two extraordinary robotics teams: I was the captain of FIRST Robotics Team Buluk 3472, and now, I serve as the Programming Lead for the University Rover Challenge team, Quantum Robotics.</p>

                    <p>One of my greatest strengths is my ability to learn and adapt quickly, which I have demonstrated through multiple personal and academic projects. These include building AI-based financial advisory tools, developing autonomous navigation algorithms for robots, and even creating a farming simulation game in Unity. Each project has allowed me to apply my skills in new and challenging ways while continually pushing my own limits.</p>

                    <p>When I’m not coding or solving technical problems, I enjoy 3D printing, podcasting, boxing, and playing basketball. I am always seeking new opportunities to grow, both personally and professionally, and I thrive in collaborative environments where I can contribute my ideas and learn from others. Feel free to check out my GitHub and LeetCode profiles to learn more about my work and achievements.</p>
